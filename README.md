## Introduction

This project simulates a system where authors can write articles for magazines. It consists of three main classes: `Author`, `Article`, and `Magazine`. The relationships between these classes are established through methods and attributes.

- The `Author` class represents an author who can write articles for magazines.
- The `Article` class represents an article written by an author for a specific magazine.
- The `Magazine` class represents a magazine to which authors can contribute articles.
